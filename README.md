🍴 Food Calorie Estimator using CNN
This project identifies food items from images and estimates their calorie content using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the Food-101 dataset.

📌 Project By: Suruchi
🤖 Role: Machine Learning Intern
🏢 Organization: Prodigy Infotech
📁 Task: Task 2 – Food Calorie Estimation
